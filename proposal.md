# New Idea
Create graphs generated in Go to accompany data analytics projects

# NOTE: Abandoned. Could not figure out if it was possible to know when an sd card was plugged in. Nothing in OS package on godocs
The goal of this utility would be to automatically transfer over photos and videos that I take onto a specified folder on my computer. The files would then be deleted off of the memory card after verifying data.
For example, I plug in my SD card and all the latest photos and videos I've taken are automatically put in a "Staging" folder locally and then removed from said SD card after data is verified.
Optional - (some sort of progress tracker or visual feedback to indicate when the process is completed)
Optional - GUI
Optional - Windows compatibility?
